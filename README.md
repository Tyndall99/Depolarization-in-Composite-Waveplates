# Depolarization-in-Composite-Waveplates
We create this code to perform the calculations of transformations of partially coherente light passing through general composite waveplate optical systems.
The objective is to create an optics library related with coherence and polarization. The code must allow to perform calculations on the transformations of partially polarized light, given an arbitrary second-order coherence function, due to composite wave-plate systems.

Those calculations are relevant in the communication channels of quantum optics and also in optical systems that involve polarization and incoherent light sources.
